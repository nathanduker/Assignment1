# Notes & Process

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->

I've been feeling very scattered lately. So I think it would be interesting to put together a small site that encapsulates an amalgamation of links, videos and pieces of media that reflect my overall mood. Something dark, not edgy but meaningful. I'd like to see if I can visualise links perhaps as pieces of glass or fragments that exist to make up a larger being/item. I feel fragmented. So I want to build something that falls within the theme of fragmentation. And hopefully make it functional along the way. It's been a  while since I've built anything for the Web, so I'm excited. 

Monotone. Black and white. Retro feel. That's what I want to go for. Something not too complicated but interesting regardless. I want it to have an almost fantasy game aesthetic.

Documenting my thoughts on how it's going so far. I like the idea of using simple shapes and black and white to build what I'm currently working on at the moment. I'm thinking aout how I can make this some kind of art piece somehow? I haven't built a site in a minute, so I'm using some of ChatGPT as a co-pilot in trying to build this out. It's been serving as a good refresher on how CSS works as a whole.

As I'm building the site, I'm sowly but surely remembering some of the key functionalities that CSS affords, which is great. I actually used to struggle a tiny bit with CSS before, but things are a lot more clearer now in hindsight. 

My initial idea for this as an art piece was to make it almost like a tiny gallery experience. But for the sake o keeping it simple I will just move forward with keeping it as is! I've always liked the idea of creating a calm, online space for the sake of meditaton, reflection and relaxation. This is what I wanted this to be. 

## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
I realise that an issue that I tend to struggle with is figuring out how positioning with CSS works and how to properly structure an HTML file for the sake of styling it.
